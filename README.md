# 🎓 University Beginner Projects

This repository contains my **early semester projects** (Semester 1–2) developed during my Computer Science degree.  
These projects are mostly written in **C and C++** and represent my **initial learning journey** into programming, problem-solving, and object-oriented concepts.

---

## 📂 Contents
The repository is organized into subfolders, each containing a small project or lab assignment:

- **Basic C++ Programs** → simple input/output, loops, conditionals  
- **Functions & Arrays** → practice with modular code and data handling  
- **Pointers & Memory** → introduction to low-level concepts  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** → classes, objects, and basic inheritance  
- **Mini Projects** → small console-based applications (e.g., calculators, number systems, student records)

---

## 🎯 Purpose
These projects are **not portfolio highlights**, but they serve as a record of my **foundation in programming**.  
They reflect my **growth from beginner-level coding** to more advanced projects later in my degree.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: C, C++  
- **Tools**: Dev C++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio

## 📌 Note
If you're interested in my **intermediate and advanced projects** (AI/ML, Data Science, Flutter applications, Final Year Project, etc.), please check my other repositories.
